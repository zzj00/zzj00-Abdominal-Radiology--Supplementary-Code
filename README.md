Deep Learning Model for Medical Imaging Based on CrossFormer
This project aims to utilize the CrossFormer architecture to construct deep learning models for T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and extract relevant deep learning features. Additionally, we employ an attention mechanism-based Transformer feature fusion module to capture spatial interactions between different sequences, enabling the development of a multi-parameter fusion model to enhance medical image analysis accuracy.

📌 Project Overview
This repository primarily includes the following components:
Deep learning model construction and training: Building and extracting features from T2WI and DWI images using CrossFormer.
Self-attention feature fusion model: Utilizing the Transformer module to integrate multi-sequence imaging data and improve analysis performance.
This project is technically supported by the onekey platform.
